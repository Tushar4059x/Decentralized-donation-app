Decentralized Donation Application
Overview
This decentralized donation application, similar to "Buy Me a Coffee," allows users to make donations directly to an Algorand wallet. The project leverages the Algorand blockchain to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of transactions.

Features
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for making donations.
Blockchain Security: Transactions are secured by the Algorand blockchain.
Transparency: All donations are recorded on the blockchain and can be publicly verified.
Decentralization: No intermediaries; donations go directly to the recipient's Algorand wallet.
